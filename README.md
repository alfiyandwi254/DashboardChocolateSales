# Dashboard Project Using Power BI

This project is based on a **Chocolate Sales dataset** from Kaggle.  
You can download the dataset from:  
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/chocolate-sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/chocolate-sales)

## Getting Started

1. After downloading the dataset, start by reviewing the table structure.  
   This will help you understand which columns are relevant for your dashboard.
   
2. I created a new table called **`MasterDate`** to support time-based visualizations.

3. Then, I built several visual elements such as:
   - Line charts  
   - Donut charts  
   - Bar charts  
   - Cards to display KPIs like total sales, total countries, etc.

4. Once the visuals were done, I designed a custom background to enhance the dashboard's aesthetics.

You can find both the **dashboard preview** and **background image** in this repository.
